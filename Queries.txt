1. Which date had the least number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?

SQL : WITH RedemptionData AS (
    SELECT 
        r.retailerName,
        rb.redemptionDate,
        rb.redemptionCount,
        rb.createDateTime,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY rb.redemptionDate ORDER BY rb.createDateTime DESC) AS rn
    FROM brahma.tblRetailers r
    JOIN brahma.tblRedemptionsByDay rb
        ON r.id = rb.retailerid
    WHERE r.retailerName = 'ABC Store'
      AND rb.redemptionDate BETWEEN '2023-10-30' AND '2023-11-05'
)
SELECT 
    redemptionDate,
    redemptionCount,
    createDateTime
FROM RedemptionData
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY redemptionCount ASC
LIMIT 1;


2. Which date had the most number of redemptions and what was the redemption count?

SQL : WITH RedemptionData AS (
    SELECT 
        r.retailerName,
        rb.redemptionDate,
        rb.redemptionCount,
        rb.createDateTime,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY rb.redemptionDate ORDER BY rb.createDateTime DESC) AS rn
    FROM brahma.tblRetailers r
    JOIN brahma.tblRedemptionsByDay rb
        ON r.id = rb.retailerid
    WHERE r.retailerName = 'ABC Store'
      AND rb.redemptionDate BETWEEN '2023-10-30' AND '2023-11-05'
)
SELECT 
    redemptionDate,
    redemptionCount,
    createDateTime
FROM RedemptionData
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY redemptionCount DESC
LIMIT 1;

3. What was the createDateTime for each redemptionCount in questions 1 and 2?

SQL : WITH RedemptionData AS (
    SELECT 
        r.retailerName,
        rb.redemptionDate,
        rb.redemptionCount,
        rb.createDateTime,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY rb.redemptionDate ORDER BY rb.createDateTime DESC) AS rn
    FROM brahma.tblRetailers r
    JOIN brahma.tblRedemptionsByDay rb ON r.id = rb.retailerid
    WHERE r.retailerName = 'ABC Store'
      AND rb.redemptionDate BETWEEN '2023-10-30' AND '2023-11-05'
),
MinRedemption AS (
    SELECT 
        redemptionDate,
        redemptionCount,
        createDateTime
    FROM RedemptionData
    WHERE rn = 1
    ORDER BY redemptionCount ASC
    LIMIT 1
),
MaxRedemption AS (
    SELECT 
        redemptionDate,
        redemptionCount,
        createDateTime
    FROM RedemptionData
    WHERE rn = 1
    ORDER BY redemptionCount DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
-- Final selection combining min and max redemption data
SELECT * FROM MinRedemption
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM MaxRedemption;


4. Is there another method you can use to pull back the most recent redemption count, by
redemption date, for the date range 2023-10-30 to 2023-11-05, for retailer "ABC Store"?
In words, describe how you would do this (no need to write a query, unless youâ€™d like to).

SQL:  SELECT 
    rb.redemptionDate,
    rb.redemptionCount,
    MAX(rb.createDateTime) AS latestCreateDateTime
FROM brahma.tblRetailers r
JOIN brahma.tblRedemptionsByDay rb
    ON r.id = rb.retailerId
WHERE r.retailerName = 'ABC Store'
  AND rb.redemptionDate BETWEEN '2023-10-30' AND '2023-11-05'
GROUP BY rb.redemptionDate, rb.redemptionCount
ORDER BY rb.redemptionDate;
